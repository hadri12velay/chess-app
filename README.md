# chess-app

Very simple 2-player chess app. 

# How to use

This is made to be run on mobile phones (tested primarly on iPhone) as a standalone web app. 
Go to [chess.hadri1.com](https://chess.hadri1.com/) on iPhone, press the "Share" button and "Add to Homescreen" (Try equivalent on Android, may work just fine).

# Features

This is very basic and experimental so don't expect tons. 
Currently, each player can move their pieces according to their respective moveset. 
Errors pop up on each player's respective UI when they are doing a move that is not allowed.
The defeated pieces appear on the bottom right of the player's UI to show progress.

Missing features (for the moment) include: 
- Turns. In the current state, each player can play whenever they want.
- Complex and rare rules (such as Castling).
- Winning screen. The game goes on forever at the moment, even if one of the king is dead.
- AI opponent. The game has to be played with someone else.
